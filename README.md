`# Course Management System

## Overview
This C++ program is a simple Course Management System that utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage and display course information. The program allows users to load course data from a CSV file, print all courses, search for a specific course by ID, and gracefully exit the program.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- Input CSV file containing course data

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Code:**
 - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
 - Compile the program, including the necessary dependencies.

2. **Run the Program:**
 - Execute the compiled binary.

3. **Program Usage:**
 - Upon running, the program will prompt you to enter the path to a CSV file containing course data.
 - Follow the on-screen menu to interact with the program:
 - `1`: Load courses from the specified CSV file.
 - `2`: Print all loaded courses.
 - `3`: Search for a course by ID and display its information.
 - `9`: End the program.

4. **Handling Invalid Input:**
 - The program handles invalid user input and prompts for re-entry.

## Important Notes
- The program assumes a proper CSV file format with columns for course ID, name, and prerequisites

## Dependencies
- C++ Standard Library

## Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! If you find issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
